Animex, created by our team for the Gator Anime Club, is an forum-style application for anime lovers to discuss relevant topics within their community in real time. Animex is a platform that combines the organizational ease of forums with the connectivity of real-time chats. Open discourse is vital to community engage, especially for groups that operate partially online. The Gator Anime Club maintains online communication simultaneously with regular club activities, which communicates their need for a product that fosters communication within a structured yet non-restrictive environment.

After logging in with a Google account or Facebook account, Animex users can peruse tagged categories and discussions to find and participate in user-created discussions. To encourage user engagement within the community, category and discussion creation is highlighted across the application with a short, clear, and customizable creation process. By combining these elements, Animex gives the anime-loving community at UF their desired online center for both free-flowing and organized communication. To protect conversations and the overall user experiences, there are moderator roles that have the power delete messages and ban users.

Animex relies on multiple software development tools to create its overall user experience. The application utilizes React so users can view rendered web pages and interact with their features. Integration of Bootstrap styling allows for a cleaner user interface. Discussion data, form information, and login information are stored through Firebase, which allows Animex to access user data that is then presented on the application. The web server that hosts Animex employs Yarn and Node to ultimately run the development server.
